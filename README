This is my fork of http://debrouwere.github.com/Extendables. See the source project for documentation and more info.

The difference with my fork is:

* have issue tracker to track issues with Extendables framework, since the original source project has no issue tracker currently.
* fix issues and offer enhancements as I get to them. See the issue tracker of open and closed issues for details. Some info might be put on the wiki as well.
